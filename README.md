## My website

This website is currently under testing. Fields being tested include device compatibility, UI design, performance, spelling/grammar, etc.

The intention of this website is to share my notes and tools − mostly for math − that may be useful to needed people.

I also use this website to store HTML notes used by myself. One day, I may open my personal blog to share my experiments and discoveries.

You can [visit it](https://harry7557558.github.io/) to see currently published tools and notes. Also, feel free to open issues for bug reports and feature requests ;)
