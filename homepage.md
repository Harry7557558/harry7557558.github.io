Hi - I am Harry, a high school student who likes math, physics, and coding. Recently, I'm interested in computer graphics.

This site was created initially for hosting pages I made for personal use. I made tools that I can't find anywhere else on the internet. You are free to use and share them, and I'm happy to see people get help from my works.

#### Pages on this site that I find most useful:

[Math notes](https://harry7557558.github.io/notes/equations.html): a math formula sheet I keep for years that can never be completed. I don't memorize all the formulas, so I check them when I need to. I "discovered" some of the equations, but their correctness is not guaranteed.

[Complex grapher](https://harry7557558.github.io/tools/complex.html): A tool for visualizing and sharing complex-variable math functions.

#### My other tools/notes that you may find helpful:

[MathJax tester](https://harry7557558.github.io/tools/mathjaxt.html): a LaTeX equation editor I used in creating math formula sheets.

[Matrix visualizer](https://harry7557558.github.io/tools/matrixv.html): interactive visualization of 2d/3d/4d transformation matrices.

[Integral substitutions](https://harry7557558.github.io/notes/substitution.html): a list of commonly used area and volume elements in calculus as well as substitutions for calculating multidimensional integral.

[SVG path tester](https://harry7557558.github.io/tools/svgpath.html): a sketchy tool for visualizing SVG path data, with moving and zooming feature.

[Chemical equation balancer](https://harry7557558.github.io/tools/chemequ.html): as a programming exercise, getting tired of doing science homework.

A backup of all of my saved Desmos graphs: [the index page](https://harry7557558.github.io/graph_backup/desmos/index.html)

#### Blogs, experiments, and explorations:

Currently, there is nothing right here. Expected to come one day!

#### Random stuff

> Just stay away and you'll be safe from me!  - Queen Elsa from the movie *Frozen*

#### Other stuffs
